heroku-local
============

Run heroku apps locally. This plugin is built into the Heroku Toolbelt, you do not need to install it separately.

To use:

```
$ heroku local
forego  | starting web.1 on port 5000
```

This command internally uses [forego](https://github.com/ddollar/forego) to run the app locally.
